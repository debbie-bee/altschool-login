      <h2>Bio:</h2>
      <p>
        Hi there! I'm Deborah Ogunkanmi, a nursing student who's also exploring
        the exciting world of technology. I'm the youngest in a big family and
        learned a lot about making the best of things while growing up in a
        regular middle-class home. Right now, I'm juggling both nursing and tech
        studies, trying to bring the two together in some interesting ways. My
        journey is all about wanting to make things better, especially at the
        crossroads of healthcare and technology.

        to connect healthcare and tech. I believe technology can really improve
        how we take care of people. That's what keeps me goingâ€”knowing I can
        create stuff that helps patients and makes healthcare work better.
